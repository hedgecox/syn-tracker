## Syn Tracker

Very simple Syn tracker designed to be used for [Slimming World](https://www.slimmingworld.co.uk/) Syn Tracking. Designed to be used as a PWA so should be added to the homescreen for the best experience. The Syn tracker has no external dependencies and stores all data in localStorage (may prove problematic if you clear your browser data often).
